How component updates are ordered
=================================

Update sequencing is performed with the aim of minimising computational cost
whilst ensuring that all wired component interactions are captured faithfully.
As such a simulation **tick** is composed of the following steps:

#. `Determine which components require an update`_
#. `Schedule possible updates`_
#. `Handle responses`_
#. `Schedule possible updates if incomplete`_


In depth walk-through
---------------------

Consider the system shown below, in which outputs of *Component A* are wired
to the input of *Component B* and the first input of *Component C*, whilst
the output of *Component B* is wired to the second input of *Component C*
and the input of *Component D*.

Determine which components require an update
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When performing a tick we begin by discovering which components require
updates, this is performed by walking the wiring to discover all dependants of
the **root** component, with the result stored in a collection named
``to_update``. In the instance where either *Component C* or *Component D* are
the **root**, only they themselves require an update. If *Component B* is the
**root**, it will require an update alongside *Component C* and *Component D*.
Whilst if *Component A* is the **root** all components require an update.

Schedule possible updates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Next, we schedule updates for all components whose dependencies have been
resolved; Dependency resolution is established by checking whether any of their
dependencies remain in ``to_update``. In the example where *Component A* serves
as the **root**, only *Component A* may have an update scheduled as all other
components have one or more of their dependencies awaiting update.
If *Component A* were not to require an update, either because *Component B*
was the root or because *Component A* had already been resolved, *Component B*
would have an update scheduled. Similarly, if *Component B* had been resolved
the updates of both *Component C* and *Component D* would be scheduled.

Handle responses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a component update is completed and the corresponding response is
received, the component can be removed from ``to_update`` and `schedule
possible updates if incomplete`_.

Schedule possible updates if incomplete
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If ``to_update`` is now empty we can assert that the state of the simulation
has been brought up to date and complete the tick, otherwise we `schedule
possible updates`_ and `handle responses`_ as performed previously.
